> OCF (or Open Cap Table Format) is an open source data standard for company capitalization data developed by the Open Cap Table Coalition to enable the easy and accurate exchange and use of company capitalization information through a standardized format.

> OCF is a JSON-based format, wherein individual objects required to describe a company cap table are stored in JSONs that match our OCF JSON Schemas. Our reference implementation suggests storing these JSONs in a specific set of files in a zip archive, but OCF-compatible data could be provided via API as well. Please see our documentation for more details on JSON Schema, OCF's schemas or how to use them.

> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
