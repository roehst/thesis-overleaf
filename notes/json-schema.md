JSON Schema is a declarative validation language for JSON documents. It is used to validate data, specially in the context of Web APIs.

It validates individual JSON documents by requiring the presence of certain fields, performing basic numeric, string (regular expression) and array (length and contents) validation, and giving support to referencing other JSON schemas to validate sub-documents.
