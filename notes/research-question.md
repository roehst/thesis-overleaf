Using the OpenCapTable Format as an object of study, this thesis aims to answer the following research questions:

R1. Can a model in a less-formal language such as JSON Schema be converted to Alloy viably?
R2. What are the costs and benefits of adopting a more formal modeling discipline such as Alloy?

Answers to R1 include:

A1. Yes, a model in JSON Schema can be converted to Alloy viably. It requires a lot of manual work, but it is possible to do so. A lot of insight is gained just by doing the translation and comparing the two models.

Answers to R2 include:

A2. The benefits of adopting a more formal modeling discipline such as Alloy include:

- The ability to use a tool to automatically generate instances of the model, which can be used to test the model and the implementation of the model.
- The ability to use a tool to automatically generate a visualization of the model, which can be used to communicate the model to others.
- The ability to state and check properties of the model, which can be used to test the model.
- The possibility of leveraging the more precise Alloy model to generate implementations and validators in a semi-automated way.
