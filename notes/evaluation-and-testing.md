Under evaluation and testing, we can:

1. Evaluate: the business logic is expressed very concisely and precisely. The use of cardinality modifiers is very helpful to express valid graphs of objects. By breaking the model in modules, the core components appear clearly. Security clearly appears as an aggregate of transactions.

2. Testing: we can give a calculation of how fast the model runs for a few different scope sizes. We can translate to roughly how many unit tests that is. We can show that many invalid cases are rejected by the model.
