Concretely, capitalization tables are a report that shows a snapshot of a company's current stakeholding structure.

Capitalization tables are a key document in negotiating new investment rounds and merger and acquisition deals.

Validating capitalization tables is challenging because it depends on each transaction that happened to the company to be valid. The order of transactions is important, i.e., they are not always commutative, so some variation of a state machine is needed to validate them.

Typically capitalization tables is maintained in a spreadsheet, whick lacks the even the most basic kinds such of quality control such as testing and version control, with essentially zero reuse of code, and seldom a single source of truth.

And almost never standardized.

Transactions can be hard to validate because startup financing involves much more complex arrangements than vanilla equity investments. Vesting schedules, convertible notes, stock option plans require validation of business rules that are defined in legal documents, which can be ambiguous or even contradictory.
