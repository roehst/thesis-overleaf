The OpenCapTable Format captured a wealth of domain/business logic but it is hampered by the use of a semi-formal specification. A more formal specification, given in Alloy, makes a standard more correct and future work is interesting.

This is expected also because JSON Schema is for validating data, not behavior or even relationships.
