By adding constraints within the `run` command in Alloy, we can use the Alloy Analyzer to characterize interesting instances of the model, that is, instances that are representative of the real world.

For example, we can quickly show how an exercise looks like; the constraints in the model will oblige the instance to have all the preceding transactions. We can also characterize all the instances involving a conversion, event-based vesting, etc.

This makes for a very powerful tool for both validating the model and communicating to users how different use cases are represented.
