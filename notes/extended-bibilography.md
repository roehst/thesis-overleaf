abstract = {In Software Abstractions Daniel Jackson introduces an approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach--which Jackson calls "lightweight formal methods" or "agile modeling"--takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. This revised edition updates the text, examples, and appendixes to be fully compatible with the latest version of Alloy (Alloy 4). The designer can use automated analysis not only to correct errors but also to make models that are more precise and elegant. This approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from "the tarpit of implementation technologies" and return them to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. Software Abstractions introduces the key elements: a logic, which provides the building blocks of the language; a language, which adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of constraint solving that offers both simulation (generating sample states and executions) and checking (finding counterexamples to claimed properties).}

@book{introductiontosoftwaretesting,
  abstract = {This extensively classroom-tested text takes an innovative approach to explaining software testing that defines it as the process of applying a few precise, general-purpose criteria to a structure or model of the software. The book incorporates cutting-edge developments, including techniques to test modern types of software such as OO, web applications, and embedded software. This revised second edition significantly expands coverage of the basics, thoroughly discussing test automaton frameworks, and it adds new, improved examples and numerous exercises. The theory of coverage criteria is carefully and cleanly explained to help students understand concepts before delving into practical applications, while extensive use of the JUnit test framework gives students practical experience in a test framework popular in the industry. Exercises, meanwhile, feature specifically tailored tools that allow students to check their own work. The book's website also offers an instructor's manual, PowerPoint slides, testing tools for students, and example software programs in Java.},

Owl, que decidimos n√£o usar

OWL Web ontology language overview

@techreport{OWL,
  abstract = {The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by applications that need to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. OWL has three increasingly-expressive sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.

This document is written for readers who want a first impression of the capabilities of OWL. It provides an introduction to OWL by informally describing the features of each of the sublanguages of OWL. Some knowledge of RDF Schema is useful for understanding this document, but not essential. After this document, interested readers may turn to the OWL Guide for more detailed descriptions and extensive examples on the features of OWL. The normative formal definition of OWL can be found in the OWL Semantics and Abstract Syntax. },

Sobre OCL, normal em alloy

@book{WarmerKleppe99,
  abstract = {The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a new notational language, a subset of the industry standard Unified Modeling Language, that allows software developers to write constraints over object models. These constraints are particularly useful, as they allow a developer to create a highly specific set of rules that governs the aspect of an individual object. As many software projects today require unique and complex rules that are written specifically for business models, OCL is fast becoming an integral facet of object development. This book is a practical guide to OCL for software architects, designers, and developers. Because it is designed for ease and usability, OCL is likely to gain broad acceptance. Much care has been taken during the design of OCL to ensure that the syntax is readable and writable by the average software modeler. The straightforward nature of OCL makes it a natural candidate to supersede current constraint languages. The authors' pragmatic approach and illustrative use of examples will help application developers to get up to speed quickly with this important object modeling method.},
