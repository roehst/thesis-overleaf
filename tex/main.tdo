\contentsline {todo}{Since in the research questions I have already given more specific results what we might expect, I can be more specific above}{2}{section*.6}%
\contentsline {todo}{In item 4, we have good references to quote from Ammans and Offutt, and we can also quote from the Alloy book}{3}{section*.7}%
\contentsline {todo}{This is very powerful and must be emphasized elsewhere}{3}{section*.8}%
\contentsline {todo}{Bring a wealth of quotes from the media, showing how LLMs are exploding, and adding a more methodological note that events are unfolding as this is written}{3}{section*.9}%
\contentsline {todo}{Complete this section with the organization of the thesis, after the rest of the thesis is written.}{3}{section*.10}%
\contentsline {todo}{Show how transactions can create securities, and how cancellations and transfers use a balancing security to allow partial cancellations and partial transfers, as a chain of transactions}{19}{section*.21}%
\contentsline {todo}{Figure in tikz showing one output entering a box with two outputs}{19}{section*.22}%
\contentsline {todo}{Give a picture of transactions as inputs coming in, outputs coming out, and outputs are balancing and resulting securities}{19}{section*.23}%
\contentsline {todo}{Give the transactions for the vesting systems}{20}{section*.24}%
\contentsline {todo}{types and enums involved in vesting transactions}{20}{section*.25}%

\contentsline {todo}{Give the examples that appear in the OCF website}{20}{section*.28}%
\contentsline {todo}{Show how quantities can be modelled using fractions and etc, show a few of the date types and rounding enums}{20}{section*.29}%
\contentsline {todo}{Give the transactions for the conversion systems}{20}{section*.30}%
\contentsline {todo}{types and enums involved in conversion transactions}{20}{section*.31}%
\contentsline {todo}{Show how conversion always means consuming a security in exchange for another in another class, still respecting security tracing}{21}{section*.32}%
\contentsline {todo}{Show how complex it is to define the rules for conversion, because they carry uncertainty \- convertible debt can convert into equity at a given ratio but also convert into a fixed percentage of the company's ownership, regardless of the valuation}{21}{section*.33}%

\contentsline {todo}{I should give that while Alloy is not particularly hard to use after learning, it is certainly not within the reach of any programmer \- after all it still requires a certain knowledge of set theory, relations and first order logic, beyond a basic grasp of how SAT solvers are used.}{45}{section*.53}%
\contentsline {todo}{We chose not to use temporal logic in our model, even though it is supported by Alloy since version 6 to keep the model simpler \- but it required some gadgetry to simulate the passage of time.}{45}{section*.54}%
\contentsline {todo}{Give that LLM models are becoming very important and Alloy provides a way to succintly encode models and verify data over domains with a lot of subtlety, and Alloy prompts seem to work very well with ChatGPT versions 3.5 onwards without any fine-tuning, and can be suprising with finetuning}{45}{section*.55}%
\contentsline {todo}{Alloy has a Java API that could be leveraged into a web-based editor that could bring such a useful technology much closer to developers. A SDK for embedding the Alloy Analyzer into other applications would also be very useful for open source contributors to explore code generation.}{45}{section*.56}%
\contentsline {todo}{A temporal model based on our model could be used to specify a complete server for managing captables that by construction follows a specification using event driven architectures}{45}{section*.57}%
\contentsline {todo}{Conclusion should be ambitious and show how exploring a domain model was much richer and ultimately leads to a better understanding of the domain, and hopefully better software for society.}{45}{section*.58}%
